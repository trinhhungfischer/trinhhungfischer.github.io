title: Hello there, I'm Game Designer!
---

Hung is an IT student who loves games and spends a lot of time playing games, and studying about Games. For me, the game is like how I show my personality and my perspective on everything. Although experienced a number of jobs as well as learned a variety of fields, Developing Games is my eventual favorite to stick with this field for a long time (shown below).
